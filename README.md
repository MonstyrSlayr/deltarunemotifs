### Adding Songs
run the site locally

then just copy the format of the songs i've put i guess (in songData.js)

make sure to put the song in the correct place according to soundtrack order

make sure to use the correct video id (use the id of the video from the official soundtrack please)

make sure to add yourself as a contributor (under all the other contributors)

then download the objects with the bug "Download Objects" button in the middle of the home page

replace motifs.json and songs.json with the downloaded files

and then run make_static_site.py (this adds the song to the website, the button will work at this point)

make sure all motif references are accurate. make sure to reference every motif reference (so that when you click the bar, it goes to the correct ref at the exact point it starts at)

thank you for contributing :)
